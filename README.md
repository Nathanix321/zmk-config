# My Keyboard Layout

First things first, big thanks to :
    - [Empress Abyss](https://github.com/empressabyss), author of the [Nordrassil](https://github.com/empressabyss/nordrassil) layout.
    - [Urob](https://github.com/urob), author of the ZMK modules I'm using and of a really good example of a [keymap](https://github.com/urob/zmk-config) that heavily inspired mine.
    - [Manna Harbour](https://github.com/manna-harbour), author of the [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku) layout, which inspired the way I handle my layers and showed me just how much you can pack in a keymap.
    - [Caksoylar](https://github.com/caksoylar), author of [keymap-drawer](https://github.com/caksoylar/keymap-drawer), the utility I used to generate the visuals.
    - [Foostan](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd/commits?author=foostan), the author of the Corne, which inspired the keyboard I actually bought :
    - The Chocofi, based on the Corne, designed by [Pashutk](https://github.com/pashutk/chocofi/commits?author=pashutk)
    - The [ZMK](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk) project and it's contributors, for making it possible to have such awesome, custom keyboard firmware.
    - And more people I surely forgot, I'm amazed at how awesome QMK and ZMK features have become in the last few years, makes me not want to buy a locked down keyboard ever again!
